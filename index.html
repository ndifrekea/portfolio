		<p style="text-indent: 50px;">It all happened on a bright tuesday in the morning,  while i was still in bed thinking of how i am going to take over the world (I dream of this everyday). Ignoring the buzz sounds coming from my phone as notifications. Suddenly i heard a mail buzz notification (i don't play with my emails), i checked and it was from Mest Team. I looked at it and took a deep breath. Could this be a humble rejection mail or an offer? After grasping my breath i opened the mail and i was filled with joy. My mission for that day was accomplished i literally felt i could take over the world. I began to reflect on the rigorous process i passed through to get into Mest, and all i could say is "it was worth it". A big shout out to family and friends for all the support, I love you all.
